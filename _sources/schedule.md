# Schedule
**Fall 2025 â€” Lecture-by-Lecture Schedule of Topics**

The schedule below is tentative, and we will slow down as common sense dictates. Weeks 1-8 cover a canon of ML methods widely used across disciplines. The final few weeks are devoted to topics with particular relevance to the social sciences.
